description: cAdvisor (Container Advisor) provides container users an understanding
  of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers.
  It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information
  about running containers. Specifically, for each container it keeps resource isolation
  parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource
  usage and network statistics. This data is exported by container and machine-wide.
