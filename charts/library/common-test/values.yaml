# The above just disables the "main" objects,
# every other config is stays as it is set in common's values.yaml.
# Tests need to use a different name, other than `main`,
# so they don't "inherit" values from common.
# The above just makes it easier to test with specific values,
# set on each test case, without having to worry about pre-defined values.

# TODO:
# It will be a test case using a different values.yaml (default-values.yaml),
# that do not disable any objects. So we can make sure that defaults apply.

# Everything disabled above, must be explicitly enabled in the default-values.yaml
# As helm first applies values.yaml and then the specified values file,
# in this case default-values.yaml
