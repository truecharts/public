## Adding a subnet to scan for new devices on LAN

This app works best when a `Subnet` is added to scan, it's rather trivial to add your home LAN subnet. My `home LAN` runs on 192.168.88.0/24 and the `interface` I used in SCALE is `br0`, but could be `eth0` or etc. Click `Add` next to `Scan Subnets` and enter your info as shown below.
