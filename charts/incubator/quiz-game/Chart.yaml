  inspired on the show "who wants to be a millionaire?". You must answer correctly
  15 questions to become a millionaire. Difficulty ascends as you progress in the
  game and questions and their categories are randomized each time you start a new
  match. At the end of your playthrough you can optionally register your score in
  the ranking, however only the top 10 results will be displayed
