# quiz-game

Test your General Knowledge in different types of topics. This game is inspired on the show "who wants to be a millionaire?". You must answer correctly 15 questions to become a millionaire. Difficulty ascends as you progress in the game and questions and their categories are randomized each time you start a new match. At the end of your playthrough you can optionally register your score in the ranking, however only the top 10 results will be displayed

TrueCharts can be installed as both *normal* Helm Charts or as Apps on TrueNAS SCALE.
