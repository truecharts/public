description: Trango self-hosted is a calling and file sharing solution that works
  over LAN (local area networks). It does not need to involve the internet for calling
  or file sharing. Ideal for offices, hotels, houses, restaurants, and any space where
  people use the same Public IP address or the same Wi-Fi network. The package comes
  with a discovery server and a web app that can be deployed on the local machine
  and can be accessed from anywhere in the network.
