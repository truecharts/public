# trango

Trango self-hosted is a calling and file sharing solution that works over LAN (local area networks). It does not need to involve the internet for calling or file sharing. Ideal for offices, hotels, houses, restaurants, and any space where people use the same Public IP address or the same Wi-Fi network. The package comes with a discovery server and a web app that can be deployed on the local machine and can be accessed from anywhere in the network.

TrueCharts can be installed as both *normal* Helm Charts or as Apps on TrueNAS SCALE.

This readme is just an automatically generated general guide on installing our Helm Charts and Apps.
