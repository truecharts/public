description:
  "Kasm(https://www.kasmweb.com/) Workspaces is a docker container streaming
  platform for delivering browser-based access to desktops, applications, and web
  services. Kasm uses devops-enabled Containerized Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) to
  create on-demand, disposable, docker containers that are accessible via web browser.
  Example use-cases include Remote Browser Isolation (RBI), Data Loss Prevention (DLP),
  Desktop as a Service (DaaS), Secure Remote Access Services (RAS), and Open Source
  Intelligence (OSINT) collections.
