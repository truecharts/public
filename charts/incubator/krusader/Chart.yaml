description:
  "Krusader is an advanced orthodox file manager for KDE and other desktops\
  \ in the Unix world. It is similar to the console-based GNU Midnight Commander,\
  \ GNOME Commander for the GNOME desktop environment, or Total Commander for Windows,\
  \ all of which can trace their paradigmatic features to the original Norton Commander\
  \ for DOS. It supports extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP,\
  \ advanced search, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content comparisons,\
  \ batch renaming, etc.\r\n"
