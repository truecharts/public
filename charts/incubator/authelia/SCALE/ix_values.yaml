## Storage Provider Configuration
##
## The available providers are: `local`, `mysql`, `postgres`. You must use one and only one of these providers.
storage:
  ##
  ## PostgreSQL (Storage Provider)
  ##
  postgres:
    port: 5432
    database: authelia
    username: authelia
    sslmode: disable
    timeout: 5s

##
## Server Configuration
##
server:
  ##
  ## Port sets the configured port for the daemon, service, and the probes.
  ## Default is 9091 and should not need to be changed.
  ##
  port: 9091

  ## Buffers usually should be configured to be the same value.
  ## Explanation at https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/server.html
  ## Read buffer size adjusts the server's max incoming request size in bytes.
  ## Write buffer size does the same for outgoing responses.
  read_buffer_size: 4096
  write_buffer_size: 4096
  ## Set the single level path Authelia listens on.
  ## Must be alphanumeric chars and should not contain any slashes.
  path: ""

##
## Redis Provider
##
## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/statelessness.html
##
## The redis connection details
redisProvider:
  port: 6379

  ## Optional username to be used with authentication.
  # username: authelia
  username: ""

  ## This is the Redis DB Index https://redis.io/commands/select (sometimes referred to as database number, DB, etc).
  database_index: 0

  ## The maximum number of concurrent active connections to Redis.
  maximum_active_connections: 8

  ## The target number of idle connections to have open ready for work. Useful when opening connections is slow.
  minimum_idle_connections: 0

  ## The Redis TLS configuration. If defined will require a TLS connection to the Redis instance(s).
  tls:
    enabled: false

    ## Server Name for certificate validation (in case you are using the IP or non-FQDN in the host option).
    server_name: ""

    ## Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow a self-signed certificate).
    ## In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the public portion of the certificate to the
    ## certificates directory which is defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the config.
    skip_verify: false

    ## Minimum TLS version for the connection.
    minimum_version: TLS1.2

  ## The Redis HA configuration options.
  ## This provides specific options to Redis Sentinel, sentinel_name must be defined (Master Name).
  high_availability:
    enabled: false
    enabledSecret: false
    ## Sentinel Name / Master Name
    sentinel_name: mysentinel

    ## The additional nodes to pre-seed the redis provider with (for sentinel).
    ## If the host in the above section is defined, it will be combined with this list to connect to sentinel.
    ## For high availability to be used you must have either defined; the host above or at least one node below.
    nodes: []
    # nodes:
    #   - host: sentinel-0.databases.svc.cluster.local
    #     port: 26379
    #   - host: sentinel-1.databases.svc.cluster.local
    #     port: 26379

    ## Choose the host with the lowest latency.
    route_by_latency: false

    ## Choose the host randomly.
    route_randomly: false

identity_providers:
  oidc:
    ## Enables this in the config map. Currently in beta stage.
    ## See https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/identity-providers/oidc.html#roadmap
    enabled: false
