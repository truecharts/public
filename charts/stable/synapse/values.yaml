    # The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
    #
    # When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
    #
    # Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
    # Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
    # will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
    #
    # This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
    # is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
    #
    # 'trustedKeyServers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
    # warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
    # 'surpressKeyServerWarning' to true.
    #
    # Options for each entry in the list include:
    #
    #    serverName: the name of the server. required.
    #
    #    verifyKeys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
    #       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
    #       one of the given keys.
    #
    #    acceptKeysInsecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
    #       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
    #       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
    #       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
    #       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
    #       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
    #       behaviour.
    #
    # An example configuration might look like:
    #
    # trustedKeyServers:
    #   - serverName: my_trusted_server.example.com
    #     verifyKeys:
    #       - id: "ed25519:auto"
    #         key: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmopqr"
    #     acceptKeysInsecurely: false
