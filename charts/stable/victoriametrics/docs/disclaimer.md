VictoriaMetrics is NOT compatible with any TrueCharts Helm Chart and not integrated into the platform, It's offered as a stand-alone chart only, it cannot be connected to any other chart offered by TrueCharts. We also do not support connecting this with any other charts offered by TrueCharts.

It might, inherently, break other charts offered by TrueCharts. Use at your own risk. No support will be offered anymore for users running any form of Metrics (prometheus or otherwise) with this chart installed.

Hence we advise heavily against using this with any other TrueCharts chart. This chart is also not covered by TrueCharts support.
