## Warning

Immich is still in a pre-alpha stage - it works, but its releases are highly unreliable and do not adhere to semantic versioning (SemVer). This means that Immich may unexpectedly break or even result in data loss.

This applies to all deployment methods - proceed with caution.

There be dragons. You've been warned. Have fun!
