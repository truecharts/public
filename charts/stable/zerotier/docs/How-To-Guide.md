## Zerotier Chart Setup

Ideally name your chart `zerotier`.

### Global Pod Options
:::danger[hostNetwork]

Host-Network is not recommended and cause side effects. Usage is not supported.

:::

If you wish to use `Host-Networking` or create an interface (`zerotier creates a network interface`)

```yaml
podOptions:
  hostNetwork: true
```

### Chart Configuration

Configuration can be done via the following environment variables:

- `ZEROTIER_API_SECRET`: Replaces the authtoken.secret before booting and allows you to manage the control socket's authentication key
- `ZEROTIER_IDENTITY_PUBLIC`: The identity.public file for zerotier-one. Use zerotier-idtool to generate one of these for you.
- `ZEROTIER_IDENTITY_SECRET`: The identity.secret file for zerotier-one. Use zerotier-idtool to generate one of these for you.

```yaml
workload:
  main:
    podSpec:
      containers:
        main:
          env:
            ZEROTIER_API_SECRET: ""
            ZEROTIER_IDENTITY_PUBLIC: ""
            ZEROTIER_IDENTITY_SECRET: ""
```

### Extra Args

If you wish to automatically join a specific Zerotier Network upon startup simply enter the `Network-ID` in this space.
**Note** This is not required for the chart to run and may not always work.

```yaml
workload:
  main:
    podSpec:
      containers:
        main:
          args: arg
          extraArgs:
            - extraArg
```

### Networking and Services

- The default ports are fine for this chart, you shouldn't need to port forward or open ports on your router.
