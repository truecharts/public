description: Socials is a single-page website that stores all your social media and personal websites to share. It is similar to tappy.tech, sociallinks.co, and linktr.ee, but open-source and built using Typescript, Sass, Express.js and EJS. Self-hosting or publishing as a static website or Chart is recommended!
