To effortlessly kickstart your journey with bitmagnet, integrate the [TrueCharts catalog](/platforms/scale/guides/getting-started/#adding-truecharts) and proceed with app installation on TrueNAS Scale.

Optionally, you can configure the `TMDB API Key` by following the guidelines outlined [here](https://bitmagnet.io/setup/configuration.html#obtaining-a-tmdb-api-key).

Worth noting, the PostgreSQL database is seamlessly configured and installed alongside the app. Just ensure to meticulously adhere to the getting started guide, installing all the recommended system before initiating the app installation process.
