## App Installation

### Storage

#### Configuration

 - The chart is set up with a default PVC that holds the application's configuration files.
 - It may be helpful to store automatic backups generated by Radarr in an external location to simplify restoration in case of an error.
   - Application backups are stored in **/config/Backups**
   - A simple way to store these backups externally is by using an NFS share.

```yaml
persistence:
  backup:
    enabled: true
    type: nfs
    path: ${NFS_PATH_BACKUPS}
    server: ${NAS_IP}
    mountPath: /config/Backups
```
- Another way to back up the application configuration is by using VolSync.
  - To reduce potential costs (e.g., for an S3 storage provider), it makes sense to exclude the **/config/MediaConver** folder from the VolSync backup. Depending on the library size, this can significantly reduce the backup size.
  - This folder does not store any configuration and will be recreated during a library scan.
  - Since there is no need to store this folder on external storage, using a simple PVC is the recommended approach.
  - This recommendation also applies to the **/config/Backups** folder mentioned above; however, using an NFS share will have the same effect.

```yaml
persistence:
  covers:
    enabled: true
    targetSelector:
      main:
        main:
          mountPath: /config/MediaCover
```

#### Media - Destination Folder

- The media destination folder is where Radarr stores completed downloads.
- This folder serves as the source for e.g. Plex or Kodi to scan media files.

```yaml
persistence:
  movies:
    enabled: true
    type: nfs
    path: ${NFS_PATH_MOVIE}
    server: ${NAS_IP}
    mountPath: /mnt/movies
```
Mounting a given NFS share to **/mnt/movies**

#### Download Folders

- This is the location where Radarr looks for completed downloads.
- It is the same location where clients such as NZBGet, SABnzbd, qBittorrent, or Syncthing save their completed movie files.

```yaml
persistence:
  downloads:
    enabled: true
    type: nfs
    path: ${NFS_PATH_DOWNLOADS}
    server: ${NAS_IP}
    mountPath: /mnt/downloads
```

Mounting a given NFS share to **/mnt/downloads**


## In-App Configuration

- For general configuration guidance, we recommend to follow the [TRaSH guides for Radarr](https://trash-guides.info/Radarr/).
- When linking Radarr to a download client, use the internal domain name of the respective download client.
  - General guidance on linking applications can be found on our website: [Linking Apps](/guides/linking-apps)
