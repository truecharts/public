TBD: Needs redoing

## Credentials

`Username` and `Password` is optional but recommended. You **_will_** need to disable Steam Guard.

`Server Admin Password` is recommended to bet set, use a strong password.

> Optionally set a `Server Password` to secure its access.

## Game ID

Set `Game ID` to **376030** (ARK Survival Evolved) or **445400** (ARK Survival of the Fittest).

`Validate` is set to true as default, verifies the game installation.

> Ark Survival Evolved supports anonymous login while _Fittest_ does **not**.

## Map

`Map` is defaulted to the `Island` map and has all the official maps in the list.

- Island
- Center
- Scorched Earth
- Ragnarok
- Aberration
- Extinction
- Genesis
- Valguero
- Crystal Isles
- Genesis 2
- Lost Island
- Fjordur

There is a `Custom Map` option that will override (and hide) `Map`.

## Parameters

`Enable RCON` will append the **?RCONEnabled=True** to `Game Parameters`.

> Set additional `Game Parameters` if you need to, with one entry per box.

In `Game Extra Parmeters (Easy)`

- `Server Flag` will append the flag **-server** to `Game Extra Parameters`.
- `Log Flag` will append the flag **-log** to `Game Extra Parameters`.
- `Crossplay Flag` will append the flag **-crossplay** to `Game Extra Parameters`.

> Set additional `Game Extra Parameters` if you need to, with one entry per box.
