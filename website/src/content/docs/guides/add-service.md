title: Adding Service

## What is a service?

Services are all sorts of ports that you want to add to your chart.

## How to Setup

To setup a service, add the following section to the values.yaml manually and adapt as needed. You can also add multiple ports to a single service.

The type can be both `Loadbalancer` and `ClusterIP` depending on your needs.

```yaml
service:
  myservice:
    enabled: true
    # only needed for loadBalancer
    loadBalancerIP: "192.168.178.11"
    type: "LoadBalancer"
    # integration needed to assign the specific loadBalancerIP via metallb
    integrations:
      metallb:
        enabled: true
    ports:
      web:
        enabled: true
        port: 8080
        targetPort: 80
        # http is set by default so can be skipped
        # protocol: http
      api:
        enabled: true
        port: 9090
        targetPort: 90
        protocol: tcp
```

In most charts there are already predefined services. You can change them to your needs (e.g. Loadbalancer/ClusterIP) as well as adding additional ones. Just make sure to choose a unique name.

### Service requirements

Please be aware that most apps already have a primary service named `main` and at least 1 primary is required.
It's also important to note that all services added by the end user should set `enabled` on all ports and services to `true`.

### Service intergrations

For each service you can add a specific integration. Metallb, Cilium or Traefik can be choosen. In above example metallb integration is used.

```
service:
  myservice:
    ##  Integration stuff
    # integration:
    #   metallb:
    #     enabled: false
    ## Optional to set shared key manually, otherwise set to namespace
    #     sharedKey: ""
    #
    #   cilium:
    #     enabled: false
    ## Optional to set shared key manually, otherwise ignored (namespace sharing)
    #     sharedKey: ""
    #
    #   traefik:
    #     enabled: false
```
