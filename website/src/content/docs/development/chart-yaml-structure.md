title: Chart.yaml layout
---

At TrueCharts we try to keep some files standardized, this enables us to make changes to these charts in bulk with less risk of mistakes. Chart.yaml is one of these files.
In this documentation we will explain the standardized layout options. For an example layout, please see our standard Chart.yaml [template](https://github.com/truecharts/public/blob/master/charts/premium/app-template/Chart.yaml)

## Layout Explained

```yaml
apiVersion: The chart API version (required)
kubeVersion: A SemVer range of compatible Kubernetes versions (optional)

deprecated: Whether this chart is deprecated (optional, boolean)
home: The URL of this projects home page (optional)

    repository: The repository URL ("https://example.com/charts") or alias ("@repo-name")
    version: The version of the chart ("1.2.3")
    condition: (optional) A yaml path that resolves to a boolean, used for enabling/disabling charts (e.g. subchart1.enabled )
    tags: # (optional)
      - Tags can be used to group charts for enabling/disabling together
    import-values: # (optional)
      - ImportValues holds the mapping of source values to parent key to be imported. Each item can be a string or pair of child/parent sublist items.
    alias: (optional) Alias to be used for the chart. Useful when you have to add the same chart multiple times
maintainers: # (optional)
  - name: The maintainers name (required for each maintainer)

    url: A URL for the maintainer (optional for each maintainer)

```

### Commenting

In the above description there are a lot of values that are not actually used. Some of those, like `deprecated`, we just set to false. While others, like `annotations` get commented out.

Please refer to our standard Chart.yaml [template](https://github.com/truecharts/public/blob/master/charts/premium/app-template/Chart.yaml) to see which unused values needs which treatment.

### Dependencies

We expect each chart to use our Common-Chart in some capacity, unless it's absolutely impossible to do so. This also means we expect the Common-Chart to always be the first dependency in the list. This enables us to easily update all common-chart references in bulk.

All other dependencies are expected to be listed in alphabetical order.

### Maintainers

The only maintainer should always be TrueCharts, as the TrueCharts core team is expected to step in if the other maintainers fail to maintain their work.
An example of how to list TrueCharts as a maintainer is available in our standard Chart.yaml [template](https://github.com/truecharts/public/blob/master/charts/premium/app-template/Chart.yaml).
