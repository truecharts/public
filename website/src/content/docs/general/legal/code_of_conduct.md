title: Code of Conduct
---


## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a productive environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a productive and discrimination-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Rules

We are a dedicated bunch of people, working on Helm Charts and Apps for multiple platforms

1. Don’t be a jerk – Try to be nice, the TrueCharts staff are trying to help, if something doesn’t work or is broken we will help or point you in the right direction. Keep personal feedback private. Got issues with someone? Send them a private message instead!
2. Read Channel Descriptions - Keep things on-topic and arguments to designated channels I.e. Check channel descriptions and pins for channel-specific rules
3. Basic Research Policy - We expect some basic research first. Specifically: try to find related information in our Announcements, our Docs and using the Discord search.
4. No trolling - This includes feigning idiocy and “shitposting”. Keeping chat lighthearted and fun is one thing. However, moronic behavior, false information and shitposting will not be tolerated.
5. No spamming - No link, text, or ASCII spam; no giant walls of text/links; and no all CAPS posts.
6. No NSFW/NSFL content outside of designated channels- This includes your avatar.
7. No begging or advertising - This includes soft begging. No referral links. No buying/selling/trading
8. Security policy: Discussing security issues or vulnerabilities that haven’t been updated is prohibited in public channels. Please report any CVE or security vulnerabilities in our charts or container mirrors using GitHub -> https://github.com/trueforge-org/truecharts/security/advisories/new
9. Comply to the platform ToS and Community Guidelines

If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let the Moderators know or us the contact information under `Enforcement`.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers and moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers and moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at moderation@truecharts.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Appeal

Everyone has the right to appeal a Ban decision. Appeals can be submitted by contacting the project team at appeals@truecharts.org
Appeals will always be processed by a maintainer or moderator that was not involved in the original decision or, in case all moderators where involved, by a majority decision of staff.
