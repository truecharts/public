Open-source projects live and die with community support. To ensure TrueCharts can continue it's great effort to become the best resource for Helm Charts and TrueNAS SCALE Apps, we aim to become fully self-funding in the future.

## Project Sponsorship and donations

Donations are gifts that do not cover a reward and will all be used by the project to cover expenses or expand our project. Be it maintaining our maintainers or our infrastructure.

### Project Sponsorship and Donations Links

You can become a sponsor of TrueCharts or make a project donation using one of the following channels:

[Open Collective](/s/oc)

[Patreon](/s/patreon)

[Github Sponsors](/s/ghs)

If you have a choice we prefer [Open Collective](/s/oc) or [Github Sponsors](/s/ghs) since [Patreon](/s/patreon) has more fees for everyone, however nothing is discouraged.
