TrueCharts is a comprehensive project that focuses on providing opinionated Helm charts for applications to run on Kubernetes-based platforms.

We also offer free support via a support-ticketing system on Discord, according to the policy laid out in this document.

## Support Rules

- If its covered by support as outlined below make a ticket in [‚Å†üé´„Éªsupport](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/936275413179723826).
- [‚Å†üé´„Éªsupport](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/936275413179723826) is not rendered on GitHub or any other platform.
- Bugs must be reported on GitHub, but only after confirmation by the staff via a [‚Å†üé´„Éªsupport ticket](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/936275413179723826)
- Anything not covered by the below Support Policy is not eligible for a [‚Å†üé´„Éªsupport ticket](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/936275413179723826). If you need assistance outside the scope of [‚Å†üé´„Éªsupport](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/936275413179723826) make a thread in an appropriate [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr).
- We help out where we can, as long as you tried to do it yourself *first*. We do not provide a walkthrough service.
- Our staff will try to help out with providing instructions on how to use `kubectl` and other `*ctl` tools where needed.
- Please be aware that the code of conduct also applies to all support.

## Expected Prior Knowledge

- How to use a shell/console/terminal and basic commands (ie. `cp`, `ls`, `etc`).
- Having read our Guides, Docs, News and Announcements.
- Basic Kubernetes know how (such as what is a "worker" node vs a "controlplane" node, what's "etcd", what's a "pod" vs a "container", etc).

## ClusterTool Support Policy

- We offer support for all ClusterTool functions, except those under `adv` and `charts`
- If you deviate from default configurations significantly, we cannot guarantee a bootstrap will work and support will be limited on a case-by-case basis.
- We do provide support for issues regarding talconfig.yaml, as long as ClusterTool is used for the deployment.
- We do provide *basic* assistance with [Talos OS](/guides/talos/), when deployed or maintained through ClusterTool (upgrades, config changes etc)
- We do provide support for FluxCD setup and layout, as long as ClusterTool is used for the deployment.
- We *only* provide support for the latest version of ClusterTool. Please ensure you are utilizing the latest version before requesting support.

## Kubernetes Support Policy

- We do not offer support for any component of kubernets that is not made by TrueCharts.
- This includes charts by other parties or manually created kubernetes manifests and deployments.

## Helm Chart Support Policy

- We offer support for all features available in our helm-charts, including all options in the common-chart.
- We offer [basic documentation](/guides/) and support for installing, upgrading and editing our Helm-Charts using Helm.
- We do not support external secret management outside of values.yaml
- We offer support for all our charts trains, except `incubator`, `dev`, and `test`.
- We cannot guarantee special characters will work flawlessly in any field.

:::note

Some [(common-chart)](../common/) features might not work correctly with all charts.

:::

## FluxCD Support Policy

- We offer support for our Helm-Charts values in FluxCD as outlined in Helm Chart Support.
- We offer [basic documentation](/guides/fluxcd/) and support on how to create a `helm-release` file, to deploy our helm-charts on Flux.
- To be eligible for FluxCD support your repository must be public.
- All information being provided *must* be un-encrypted. You can obfuscate any sensitive information as needed.

## What's Explicitly Not Covered By Support

- Troubleshooting complete clusters, outside of just our Helm-Charts.
- CloudFlare proxying.
- The software *contained* in our Helm Charts (for example "how to configure Radarr to connect to a torrent client?").
- How to install additional tools (like: [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), [talosctl](https://www.talos.dev/latest/talos-guides/install/talosctl/), [flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cmd/) etc)
- We do not support any Cloud providers or OpenShift.

:::note

If an issue is covered support create a [‚Å†üé´„Éªsupport ticket](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/936275413179723826) for assistance.

For all issues not covered by support you can make a thread in an appropriate [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) for assistance from the community.
