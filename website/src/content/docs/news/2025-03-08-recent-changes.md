The TrueCharts team has made several major updates to the Helm Project, focusing on improving stability, removing deprecated content, and providing a wealth of new resources for users. Here’s a rundown of the latest changes:

## Deprecation & Removal of Mirrored Upstream Charts

As part of an effort to streamline and refine the project, TrueCharts has officially deprecated and removed most mirrored upstream charts. Users are encouraged to read the newly updated Quick-Start Guide for assistance with these changes, ensuring a smooth transition.

## Expansion to Stable Charts

In a significant update, TrueCharts has moved 15 charts from the incubator to the stable train, ensuring they are now fully ready-to-use. Additionally, the community has added 5 completely new charts to the stable train, expanding the selection of reliable and robust options available to users.
