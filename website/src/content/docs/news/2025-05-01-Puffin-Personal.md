Hey everyone,

Kjeld here — most of you know me as **MrPuffin**, or back in the day, **Ornias**.

Over the past year, we’ve been quietly but steadily working on something big at TrueCharts. Behind the scenes, we’ve focused hard on professionalizing and restructuring the project to make it more sustainable, more scalable, and frankly, more awesome.

Our core energy has been steadily shifting toward **building out and refining our Common Chart**, improving our **CI/CD pipelines**, and developing tooling like **clustertool** — all with the goal of supporting better automation and long-term maintainability. It’s been a gradual but deliberate transition in focus, setting the stage for a more sustainable future for the project.

In the meantime, the **charts catalog** itself has organically evolved. It’s now primarily driven by **community contributions**, which is incredible to see. People like **Alfi** and **jagrbombs** from our core team are doing fantastic work reviewing and maintaining the quality of incoming PRs. And let’s not forget **Stavros**, who’s been laser-focused on the Common Chart and pushing forward with unit tests and technical improvements.

But with all this growth comes a shift.

As life changes on my end too, I’ve come to realize I simply can’t do it all — not if we want to keep doing things right. So it’s time for a new phase.

You’ll notice on the [team page](https://truecharts.org/team) that I’m officially stepping back from day-to-day involvement with the general chart catalog. That means fewer interactions from me on community chart PRs and general contributions.

Instead, I’ll be focusing 100% of my energy on what matters most for the long-term success of the project:

- Developing new features for the **Common Chart**
- Maintaining and improving our **CI/CD and deployment/testing pipelines**
- Coordinating and supporting our amazing **volunteer staff**

In practice, that means the chart catalog will be almost entirely community-driven — and that’s by design. We’ve built the structure for it, and now it’s time to let it grow.

So, yes, you’ll probably see **less of me in Discord** and around the edges of the project. But rest assured, I’m still here, still fully committed, just with a more focused role behind the scenes (and on GitHub, of course).

Thanks to everyone who’s helped us get here. This isn’t the end of anything — it’s just the next logical step forward.

**Onwards and upwards,**
**Kjeld (MrPuffin)**
