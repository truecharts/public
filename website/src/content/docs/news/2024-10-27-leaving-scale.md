With the recent announcement that TrueNAS SCALE 24.10 "Electric Eel" will no longer support Kubernetes-based applications, we at TrueCharts understand that some of our users may be considering a move away from TrueCharts entirely. As TrueCharts has also ended support for TrueNAS SCALE Apps, we recognize the importance of offering pathways for users who want to adjust to this new direction.

For those looking to transition away from TrueCharts, whether by migrating to alternative options such as Docker Compose or using iX-Systems-made Apps, our latest subproject, **ClusterTool**, provides a powerful solution. ClusterTool has been developed to simplify the migration process, giving users the flexibility to transition smoothly to the setup that best suits their needs.

Even for users who aren't looking to establish their own Kubernetes cluster, **ClusterTool** offers robust functionality to export TrueNAS SCALE App configurations. Users can easily convert their GUI-based App configurations into clean, readable YAML files. This export feature preserves existing configurations, providing a record that can be adapted for future deployments or alternative environments without re-entering every setting from scratch.

To help users get started, we've created a detailed guide outlining how to use ClusterTool for this purpose. Access the guide and learn how to seamlessly migrate or export your SCALE configurations here: TrueCharts Guide on Exporting SCALE Configurations. *(2025 note: Migration is no longer possible or supported)*

Here you can Download the RC-Release of ClusterTool here: [Download Link](https://github.com/truecharts/public/releases).

We remain committed to supporting our community, whether users are transitioning to different solutions or adapting their setups within the evolving TrueNAS SCALE environment.
