iXsystems just released TrueNAS SCALE 22.12.1 into the wild.

We've went ahead and reviewed the release notes, [available here](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scale22.12/#22121)

There aren't any changes that should prevent apps from functioning moving from 22.12 to 22.12.1. Hence we've decided to expand support for our Apps to both versions as well.

Please be aware, however, that both migration and backups are broken in 22.12, which are both fixed in 22.12.1. So we would still heavily advice anyone to update. Although the TrueTool hotpatch for 22.12, solves the issues for most users as well.
