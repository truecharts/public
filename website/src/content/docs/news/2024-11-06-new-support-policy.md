We’re thrilled to announce an all-new **Support Policy** led by our amazing support lead, @kqmaverick! You can ignore all previous announcements on scope and policies—no more "you need to be able to maintain your own cluster"! Check out the full policy here: [Support Policy](https://truecharts.org/general/support-policy/).

### What's New:
- **Comprehensive Support**: Our support now covers both "technical support" for bug reports and code issues, as well as our free support service on Discord, thanks to our dedicated volunteer staff.

- **Docs Overhaul**: We’ve streamlined our documentation, merging clustertool pages into general docs and reintroducing a project-wide system requirements page.

- **Content Cleanup**: Outdated TrueNAS SCALE content has been removed to make our resources even more relevant for a Kubernetes future!

In addition, TrueCharts is now officially hosting **community gameservers**! Our first release is a **Minecraft server**, co-hosted in collaboration with Six-Shooter.

🚀 **Upcoming Release**: We’re excited to announce that **ClusterTool v1.0.0** will be released in two weeks!

And don’t forget to **vote in our Discord poll** about your container plans! Join us on Discord to stay updated: [Vote Here](https://discord.com/channels/830763548678291466/830763549156573216/1302988338755797042).
