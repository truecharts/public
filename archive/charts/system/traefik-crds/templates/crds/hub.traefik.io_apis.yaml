          API defines an HTTP interface that is exposed to external clients. It specifies the supported versions
          and provides instructions for accessing its documentation. Once instantiated, an API object is associated
          with an Ingress, IngressRoute, or HTTPRoute resource, enabling the exposure of the described API to the outside world.
