##### Adding the App

- Go to `Available Applications`

- On the last step, review any changes you made to the defaults in the summary
- Click `Submit` to install your App of choice
- Under `Installed applications` you will see a new tile with the name of your App
- Wait a few minutes untill the App is started, a `Portal` button will appear that takes you to the GUI of your App of choice
