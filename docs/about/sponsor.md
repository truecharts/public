# Sponsors and Donators

### Sponsorship

As a project we try to maintain strict independence and financial ethics, this means we will not take money for any kind of promotion or attention.
This includes any form of direct sponsorships.

However: We are always open to promoting great projects and those projects are free to donate to us as a "thank you".

### Donations

As we have no formal legal entity, all donations are handled by the project maintainer. Currently donations do not exceed a significant enough amount, to warrant a change to that policy.
